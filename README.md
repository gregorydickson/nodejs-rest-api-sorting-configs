My absolutely second node.js program.

Saving configs json documents in REST style. I started with using an in-memory database (Loki) but then realized that it added functionality that the test wanted me to build so I removed it and used an array of objects.

After finishing this I am now ready to re-write (factor) it ;-)

1) npm install in root project directory
2) test by running mocha in root project directory
